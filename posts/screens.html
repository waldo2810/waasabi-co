      <p>I want to get away from screens.</p>
      <p>
        As a Software Engineer, I am staring at a computer screen for 12+ hours
        a day because it’s part of my job. That’s half of the 24 hours available
        every day. Ok, I can cope with that. It’s not like i’m messing around
        right? I am literally working so I can survive in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        6 to 7 hours out of those 24 are spent sleeping. Ok, I can cope with
        that. I need to sleep so I can work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, I get home (or close the lid if working from home). I need to
        check if course and get up to date with what’s going on, from family,
        friends and news (tech news, mostly). That converts to the remaining 6
        hours of my day if i’m completely honest. Proof below.

      <p>I’m literally this guy.</p>

      <p>
        I currently feel that I have little to no time for reading. No time for
        family. No time to see the world. It’s sucking my energy and screens
        have become the central part of my life. I don’t want that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to change this. I don’t mean to stop every single screen or
        change my career or even being offline forever. Nothing like that. I
        love my career and I would never change it. I just want to get away from
        screens as much as I can make a better use of the time I can control,
        beyond my job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Planing changes on my routine is the easy part. That is done, now
        applying those changes it’s the challenge i want to dive in by the end
        of this year. I could share the plan here so I feel a little bit of
        pressure as my digital footprint will haunt me for saying things i don’t
        make up to.
      </p>
      <p>I can write a lot more about this but point has been cleared out.</p>
      <p>Touch grass.</p>
      <p>Wish you the best, Waldo.</p>
